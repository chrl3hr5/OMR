# OMR
Calling R from OpenModelica through C for executing the following operations -

1. **Performing general-purpose optimization** - Using the built-in *optim()* function of R.
2. **Solving ordinary differential equations** - Using the *ode()* function from *deSolve* package of R.

The work was presented at the [OpenModelica Annual Workshop 2022](https://openmodelica.org/events/openmodelica-workshop/openmodelica-program-2022-a/), organized by the Open Source Modelica Consortium (OSMC) and Link√∂ping University (LIU).
